Relational databases are one of the most common ways real-world data is stored and accessed. SQL (Structured Query Language) databases organize data into tables with well-defined schemas, making them efficient for querying, filtering, and aggregating large datasets. By linking an SQL database to an LLM, we can move beyond static documents and enable the model to answer questions grounded in structured, up-to-date data. This is a powerful extension of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), allowing the LLM to reason over rows, columns, and relationships rather than just text. An introduction to SQL can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp).

## Adding a SQL Database
We will now add an existing SQL server to our Open WebUI instance. Specifically, we will connect a [soccer database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) from Kaggle, containing over 25,000 matches and over 10,000 players. We set up this server using [PostgreSQL](https://www.w3schools.com/postgresql/), a widely used open-source object-relational database management system. We will first add a **tool** to our Open WebUI, which will specify how the LLM should execute SQL queries. Then, we will specify the specifics of our SQL server in the valves of the tool.

### 1. Adding the SQL Tool
We will first add a Tool to Open WebUI that teaches the LLM how to talk to a database.

> 1. Go to your **workspace**, on the left side of the screen. Then, move to **Tools** at the top of the screen.
> 2. Click on **+ New Tool**, name it `SQL_Soccer` and replace the template code with the code below. Don't forget to **save the tool**.

{: .note}
> * The tool is built using **SQLAlchemy**, which provides a unified interface for connecting to different SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle) with minimal changes to the code.
> * Database connection details (host, user, password, port, database name, and type) are defined in the **Valves** class. These values can be adjusted from the Open WebUI interface without modifying the code itself.
> * The `_get_engine()` method dynamically constructs the correct connection string based on the selected database type and returns a reusable SQLAlchemy engine.
> * The `execute_read_query` function strictly enforces **read-only access**. Only SELECT-style queries are allowed, and potentially destructive SQL keywords (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP) are explicitly blocked.

### 2. Configuring the Connection (The Valves)
Now that we have added the tool, all that remains is to specify the details of our SQL server in the valves. Then, we can use our LLM to execute SQL queries of our liking.

{: .action}
> In your **Workspace**, under **Tools**, click on the gear icon to adjust the valves. Specify the details below (case sensitive!):
> * **Db Host:** 91.92.143.253
> * **Db User:** participant
> * **Db Password:** _See password on the screen in the room_
> * **Db Name:** soccer_db
> * **Db Port:** 5432
> * **Db Type:** postgresql

### 3. System Prompting
Tools are "passive" - the LLM often forgets to use them or refuses to run code due to safety training. We must give it a specific task description to force it to behave like a Data Analyst. Select and copy one of the prompts from the _Prompt Library_. Click [the link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJExGSSCe7ub5EiPJOFTh6FkvOYtRDyHruoi97CqC5A/edit?usp=sharing) to see the different system prompt options.

{: .action}
> 1. When you are in a chat, go to your Chat Controls (top right settings icon).
> 2. Paste the system prompt you chose into the System Prompt field.
> 3. Click Save (or close the panel).

### 4. Testing the Connection
Now you're tool is all ready! It is time to start experimenting and evaluate how well your LLM can query the database. Have a look at the [database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer), and think about what questions you may ask.

{: .action}
> When starting a new chat, in your chat window, click on _Integration -> Tools_, and toggle on your tool. Now the access to the SQL database is enabled. You can now ask the LLM questions that can be answered based on the database. Try it out, how well does it perform? In what cases does it not behave as you expected? Below are a few questions you can test
> * **Discovery:** _"List all the tables in the database."_ (Tests connection)
> * **Schema:** _"What columns are in the `player` table?"_ (Tests schema reading)
> * **Data Retrieval:** _"Get me the height and weight of player 'Aaron Appindangoye'. Do not guess."_ (Tests full execution)

{: .note}
> Important: SQL is case-sensitive. The table is likely named player, not Player.

## Additional exercise: Launching Your Own SQL Server
In the previous part, you were using a SQL database that we are running using PostgreSQL. Now, you will launch your own SQL database, using SQLite. Unlike PostgreSQL or MySQL, SQLite does not run as a separate server. Instead, the entire database lives in a single .sqlite file. This makes SQLite ideal for lightweight experiments and local development. We will first set up our environment on our compute instance, after which we pull a database from Kaggle.

{: .action}
> You will first need to make an account on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com), and set up an API key. Once you made your account, click on your profile picture at the top right to go to the settings. In the settings, generate an **API token** and save it carefully, you will need it to pull a dataset to your compute instance.

Now, we will guide you through the steps to launch your own SQL server and add it to your Open WebUI. Follow the steps below carefully.

{: .action}
> Follow the steps below to prepare your environment with `uv`. For each step, copy the code and paste and execute it on the command line of your compute instance.

* **Step 1:** Install the `uv` environment manager:
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```

* **Step 2:** Initialize your environment:
```
cd ~
uv init sql
cd sql
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install kaggle
```

* **Step 3:** Configure your Kaggle API credentials. 
    * First make the directory: `mkdir -p ~/.kaggle`
    * Now create the file: `nano ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`
    * Add the credentials in this format: `{"username":"<your_username>","key":"<your_api_key>"}`
    * Set the permissions correctly: `chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`

* **Step 4:** Download a specific dataset, for example [tweets on US airline sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment?select=database.sqlite)
```
kaggle datasets download -d crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment
sudo apt install unzip
unzip twitter-airline-sentiment.zip
```
* **Step 5:** Install sqlite on your compute instance, in case you want to explore queries locally. Then copy the database to your Open WebUI backend.
```
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 -y
sudo cp database.sqlite ../data_openwebui/
```

* **Step 6:** Adjust the valves of your tool to point to your local database. Specifically, you should specify:
    * **Db Host:** localhost
    * **Db User:** admin (default value)
    * **Db Password:** admin (default value)
    * **Db Name:** /app/backend/data/database.sqlite
    * **Db Port:** 3306 (default value)
    * **Db Type:** sqlite
 
* **Step 7:** Explore the newly linked SQL database! You are now exploring an SQL database hosted on your own compute instance. What can you find out about the data? You can still not modify your data, due to the constraints in the tool code. If you wish, you can try to alter the tool code to allow yourself to modify the database.

> You may have to help the LLM to find the right column names, in order to compose the correct queries. Below, you can see an overview of the columns of the database.
